- 👋 Hi, I’m @kaxahdan.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to create and verify documents using blockchain through Blockcert's open-source templates. When successful, I'd like to blockchainize certification matters in the school I'm working on--both for security and credibility reasons. 
- 💞️ I just do not have any coding experience, so I'm not too sure where to start from....
